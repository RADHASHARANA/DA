**Calculus:**

1. **Limits:**
   - Understanding the concept of limits and how they describe the behavior of a function as the input approaches a certain value.
   - Evaluating limits algebraically and graphically.
   - One-sided limits and infinite limits.

2. **Continuity and Differentiability:**
   - Understanding what it means for a function to be continuous at a point and on an interval.
   - Identifying discontinuities and understanding their types (removable, jump, and essential).
   - Differentiability and the relationship between continuity and differentiability.
   - Derivatives and their interpretation as rates of change.

3. **Taylor Series:**
   - Understanding Taylor polynomials and Taylor series as approximations for functions.
   - Calculating Taylor polynomials and series expansions.
   - Using Taylor series to approximate functions and estimate function values.

4. **Maxima and Minima:**
   - Identifying critical points where the derivative is zero or undefined.
   - Determining local maxima, local minima, and saddle points using the first and second derivative tests.
   - Understanding the concept of concavity and points of inflection.

**Optimization:**

1. **Optimization Involving a Single Variable:**
   - Solving optimization problems where you need to find the maximum or minimum value of a function within a given interval.
   - Identifying constraints and using them to set up the optimization problem.
   - Using the first derivative test to find critical points and determine the nature of extrema.
